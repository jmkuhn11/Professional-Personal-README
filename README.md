## Description

I am a developer who needs to use README files for every project. They are a quick and easy way to introduce someone else to the work I have completed, and how to use them properly. It is also an easy way to have other people get in direct contact with me if they like the work/skills I display. Thus, since I create so many README files for various projects, I created a README generator so I can create them in a fast yet professional manner. Through making this project I have gained a better understanding of node.js and the terminal on VS code. I also added to my knowledge of the different aspects one can add to their README files to make it easier for clients to use.

## Installation

Install Node.js, and use "inquirer" as a dependency on VS code

## Usage

This project is a quick and easy way for one to make professional README files for their projects. By opening up the javascript file on the VS terminal, a user will be prompted to answer questions regarding the content they want displayed on their file. Then without any formatting, the project will automatically fill in their answers and create a README with a title, table of contents, various sections of information, and contact info at the bottom. And whether or not it's perfect, one can also just use this as a starting point to add more personalized content for the project as well. Just copy and paste from the file what you want to use, and you will have easily formatted and answered sections at the ready.
